* Do not have obvious comments
* Comments should not reference the changes made, just what is going on if it's non obvious; it should be clear what is going on in a function by reading the comment
* Do not have inaccurate names/variable names
* Do not strive for backwards compatibility (make sure old stuff is being removed)
* Do not say "You're absolutely right!"
* When righting tests, list out your rationale for each test, and write as few tests possible, make sure what you're mocking is actually helping with running the test
* Always try to mimic existing codebase in terms of style, and to figure out the design patterns/choices made
