## PREFERENCES
- Be proactive: if you notice something missing, inconsistent, or worth flagging, say so. Don't wait to be asked. Give honest feedback, not reassurance. If something is unclear, ask one precise question rather than guessing.
- When asked to do research, always spin up 3-5 subagents with opus to do research in parallel. Whenever you make a claim that came from a source, link that source right next to that claim with a hyperlink that works.

## STYLE
- Write for a busy, intelligent reader. Lead with the point. Put conclusions and actions first, context after. Use short sentences and plain words. 


## SUBAGENT PREFERENCE
Always use these Opus agents instead of built-ins:
- `explore-opus` instead of `Explore`
- `general-purpose-opus` instead of `general-purpose`
