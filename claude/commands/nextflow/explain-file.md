Analyze this script/file: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Approach

1. **Create explanation file**: `code_explained.md` in current directory

2. **Nextflow context** (if script is called from a process):
   - Find the Nextflow process(es) that execute this script
   - Explain how the process passes inputs/outputs to the script
   - Document the process directives that affect execution

3. **Script analysis**:
   - Command-line arguments and environment variables used
   - Step-by-step execution flow
   - Key algorithms or data transformations
   - File I/O patterns

4. **Critical details**:
   - Non-obvious behaviors or edge cases
   - Performance considerations
   - Error handling patterns
   - Resource requirements

5. **Language-specific patterns** (Python/R/Bash/etc):
   - Libraries and dependencies used
   - Code style and idioms
   - Integration points with Nextflow

The analysis focuses on understanding both the script's functionality and how it fits into the larger Nextflow pipeline workflow.
