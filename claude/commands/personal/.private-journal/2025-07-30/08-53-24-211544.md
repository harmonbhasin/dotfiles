## Project Notes

Created @write_docs.md command that enforces comprehensive documentation practices. The command includes:
- 8 required sections covering overview through debugging
- Writing principles emphasizing explicitness
- A checklist to verify documentation quality
- Example structure showing proper formatting

This command should be used after implementing features to ensure proper documentation is created.
