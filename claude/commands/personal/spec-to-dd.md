# Collaborative Design Document Development

Let's work together to transform our high-level design into a detailed implementation plan. I'll guide us through each phase, pausing for your input and refinement.

## Phase 1: Blueprint Development
First, let's outline the major components and their interactions. I'll propose an initial structure, then we'll iterate together:
- I'll suggest key components and their responsibilities
- You tell me what's missing, what needs adjustment, or what concerns you have
- We'll refine until you're satisfied with the high-level architecture

## Phase 2: Implementation Decomposition
Once we have our blueprint, let's break it down together:
- I'll propose an initial breakdown into implementation chunks
- You review and tell me if any chunks feel too big, too small, or in the wrong order
- We'll discuss dependencies and identify potential risks
- Together we'll create a sequence that builds incrementally

## Phase 3: Step Validation
Before finalizing, let's review each step through these lenses:
- Can each step be tested independently?
- Does each step provide visible progress?
- Are there any hidden complexities we're missing?
- What could go wrong at each stage?

## Phase 4: Implementation Planning
For each validated step, we'll collaboratively define:
- Acceptance criteria (what done looks like)
- Test strategy (how we'll verify it works)
- Integration points (how it connects to previous work)
- Any specific technical decisions needed

## Deliverables
Throughout our discussion, I'll maintain:
- `design-doc.md`: Our evolving blueprint and technical decisions
- `implementation-plan.md`: The sequenced steps with details
- `decision-log.md`: Key decisions and their rationale
- `todo.md`: Current status and next actions

At each phase, I'll pause for your input before proceeding. Ready to start with Phase 1?
