# Laws of UX - Complete Reference

## Gestalt Principles (Visual Perception)

### Law of Common Region
Elements sharing a clearly defined boundary are perceived as a group.
- Use cards, panels, boxed sections to signal cohesive units
- Subtle background color changes create psychological boundaries
- Define distinct boundaries for header, sidebar, footer areas

### Law of Proximity
Objects near each other are perceived as grouped.
- Spatial closeness creates perceived connections
- Use whitespace to separate unrelated elements, compress related ones
- Proper spacing dramatically improves scannability

### Law of Pragnanz
People interpret complex images as the simplest form possible.
- Simplify iconography and visual hierarchies
- Group related elements into unified visual blocks
- Minimize decorative complexity without functional purpose

### Law of Similarity
Similar elements are perceived as part of the same group.
- Apply uniform visual treatment to related buttons, inputs, navigation
- Use consistent colors for specific element types
- Ensure interactive elements visually differentiate from static text

### Law of Uniform Connectedness
Visually connected elements are perceived as more related.
- Use colors, lines, frames, or shapes to group related functions
- Apply explicit visual connectors when spacing prevents close placement

## Cognitive Psychology

### Cognitive Bias
Systematic thinking errors that influence perception and decisions.
- Users employ mental shortcuts based on past experiences
- Design for actual mental processes, not ideal rationality
- Set sensible defaults since users rely on heuristics

### Cognitive Load
The mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.
- Reduce decision points and visual clutter
- Use progressive disclosure to present information gradually
- Establish clear hierarchy with typography, spacing, color

### Mental Model
What users think they know about how a system works.
- Users apply existing mental models from familiar systems
- Use established conventions (shopping carts, standard nav, familiar icons)
- Align interface behavior with user expectations

### Miller's Law
Average person keeps 7 (plus/minus 2) items in working memory.
- Break content into smaller, meaningful chunks
- Organize elements logically rather than limiting features
- Account for individual variation in memory capacity

### Selective Attention
People focus only on information relevant to their current goals.
- Prioritize visual hierarchy to direct focus
- Avoid styling content like ads (banner blindness)
- Use contrast and positioning for critical actions

### Working Memory
Cognitive system that temporarily holds info needed to complete tasks.
- Retains only 4-7 chunks, fading within 20-30 seconds
- Support recognition over recall
- Persist selections and form data across page transitions

## Decision Making

### Choice Overload
Excessive options hinder decision-making and satisfaction.
- Limit initial options; use filters and search
- Enable side-by-side comparisons for complex decisions
- Prioritize recommended options; use progressive disclosure

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with number and complexity of choices.
- Minimize critical choices when speed matters
- Segment complex tasks into manageable stages
- Highlight preferred solutions; use progressive disclosure

### Paradox of the Active User
Users never read manuals; they start using software immediately.
- Design with embedded assistance in the user experience
- Implement contextual tooltips, microcopy, help panels
- Minimize setup friction with sensible preconfigured options

## Memory & Attention

### Serial Position Effect
Superior recall for items at beginning and end of sequences.
- Place primary actions at beginning or end of menus
- Position essential form inputs at start or finish
- Reserve middle positions for supporting information

### Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)
The item that differs from the rest is most likely remembered.
- Use distinctive styling for primary actions to guide attention
- Apply contrast selectively; don't create competing visual elements
- Don't rely solely on color differentiation (accessibility)

### Zeigarnik Effect
People remember uncompleted tasks better than completed tasks.
- Use progress bars to visualize completion status
- Break long forms into visible steps
- Display progress toward completion to encourage finishing

### Peak-End Rule
Experiences judged by peak intensity and ending, not average.
- Design around emotionally intense points and conclusions
- Enhance moments of maximum value delivery
- Ensure final interactions receive premium design attention

## Interaction Design

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Pleasing design is perceived as more usable.
- Visual appeal creates positive responses
- Users show greater patience with polished presentation
- Balance visual refinement with functional clarity

### Doherty Threshold
Productivity soars when interactions complete under 400ms.
- Aim for <400ms; anything slower needs visual feedback
- Use animations, spinners, progress bars during loading
- Focus on both actual performance and perceptual design

### Fitts's Law
Time to acquire target = function of distance and size.
- Make interactive elements sufficiently large (min 44x44px touch)
- Maintain adequate distance between targets
- Position controls near users' primary task areas

### Flow
State of energized focus, complete engagement, and enjoyment.
- Balance challenge with user skill level
- Provide continuous feedback about actions
- Remove unnecessary obstacles; streamline responsiveness

### Goal-Gradient Effect
Approach tendency increases with proximity to goal.
- Display progress bars and completion percentages
- Break processes into visible checkpoints
- Avoid friction near end of workflows

### Jakob's Law
Users prefer your site to work like other sites they know.
- Build on established patterns
- Mirror familiar digital counterparts
- Gradually phase out older versions when introducing changes

### Postel's Law
Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send.
- Accept multiple input formats; normalize internally
- Provide helpful feedback for deviations, not rigid rejection
- Support various interaction methods and assistive tech

### Tesler's Law (Conservation of Complexity)
Inherent complexity cannot be eliminated, only transferred.
- Handle validation, calculations, logic server-side
- Pre-configure sensible defaults
- Provide integrated help mechanisms

## Design Philosophy

### Occam's Razor
Among equal hypotheses, choose the one with fewest assumptions.
- Prevent complexity from accumulating
- Remove everything unnecessary while preserving function
- Optimal when nothing more can be removed

### Pareto Principle
80% of effects come from 20% of causes.
- Identify features generating 80% of user value
- Allocate resources strategically, not evenly
- Focus on high-impact areas serving broadest needs

### Parkinson's Law
Tasks inflate to fill available time.
- Set reasonable completion timeframes
- Use progress indicators to set expectations
- Design flows with minimal required steps

### Chunking
Breaking info into smaller meaningful units.
- Use spacing, borders, background colors for distinct groups
- Apply consistent organization patterns
- Use typography, color, layout for information priority
