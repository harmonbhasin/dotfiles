name: email-outreach
description: Helps write personalized outreach emails using YC's frameworks (startup/founder) or Sam McKenna's SMYKM method (enterprise/exec). Use when drafting cold, warm intro, or follow-up emails.
---

## Task

Help draft or critique outreach emails — cold, warm intro, or follow-up — optimized for response rate.

**First step: ask the user which framework to use** via `AskUserQuestion` before drafting anything.

> "Which outreach style do you want?"
> - **SMYKM (Show Me You Know Me)** — Deep personalization for high-value targets, enterprise execs. Longer emails, "+" subject lines, objection handling built in.
> - **YC Startup** — Tight, fast founder-to-founder outreach. 50-125 words, direct CTA.

Then read the corresponding reference file and follow that framework.

## Mode Selection Guide

| Signal | SMYKM | YC |
|--------|-------|----|
| C-suite / VP / senior exec target | Yes | |
| Enterprise / large company | Yes | |
| Rich personal intel available | Yes | |
| High-value deal worth deep research | Yes | |
| Founder-to-founder | | Yes |
| Startup-to-startup, high volume | | Yes |
| Warm intro / referral | | Yes |
| Follow-up sequences (email 2+) | | Yes (with SMYKM timing) |

## Email Anatomy — Both Frameworks

**YC:** Opener -> Credibility -> Value prop -> CTA (50-125 words)

| Section | Length | Purpose | Key Rule |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| Personalized opener | 1-2 sentences | Show you researched THEM | About the recipient, not you |
| Credibility | 1 sentence | Why take you seriously | YC batch, relevant experience, social proof |
| Value prop | 1 sentence | ROI for them, not features | Use customer language |
| CTA | 1 sentence | Clear next step | 15 min ask, Calendly + availability option |

**SMYKM:** Subject line (SMYKM) -> First sentence -> Transition -> Value prop + Objection handling -> Close (longer OK for execs)

| Section | Purpose | Key Rule |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Subject line | Gate to the email | SMYKM content + "+" format |
| First sentence | Preview text decides opens | Implied intro or straight SMYKM |
| Transition | Bridge personal to business | Stay conversational |
| Value prop + Objection handling | Challenge you solve + preempt #1 objection | Longer is better for execs |
| Close | Get the meeting | No calendar links, work around THEIR schedule |

## Output Format

**YC mode:**
```
**Subject:** [short, intriguing, personalized]
**Body:** [50-125 words, 3-5 sentences]

---
Rationale: [Why this approach for this recipient]
```

**SMYKM mode:**
```
**Subject:** [SMYKM "+" format, specific to prospect]
**Body:** [5-part structure, longer is OK for execs]

---
Rationale: [Research layers used, objection anticipated, authentic tie-back]
```

## Outreach Priority

Use the highest-available channel:

| Priority | Channel | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Your network | You already know someone at the company |
| 2 | Warm intro | A mutual connection can introduce you |
| 3 | YC alumni / community | Shared community affiliation |
| 4 | Personalized cold email | No connection — research hard, write tight |

## Tone Rules

- Write like talking to a friend at a conference
- Read it aloud — if you wouldn't say it, don't write it
- "Hey" > "Hello", drop unnecessary "I" at sentence starts
- Use emotions ("I'd really appreciate...", "It would mean a lot...")
- Grammar must be flawless — recommend Grammarly for non-native speakers
- Never use buzzwords: "synergy", "leverage", "disrupt", "revolutionary"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Talking about yourself first | Lead with recipient |
| Vague ask ("pick your brain") | Specific CTA (15 min demo) |
| Too many value props | One value prop, one sentence |
| Generic "Hi there" | "Hey [First Name]" |
| No credibility signal | Add YC batch, relevant experience, or social proof |
| Demanding tone | Offer value first |
| Too long (>125 words) — YC mode | Cut to 50-125 words |
| Calendar link in close — SMYKM mode | "Do you have time over the next week or two?" |
| Inauthentic personalization | Every SMYKM ref must tie back to YOU |
