# SMYKM Framework — "Show Me You Know Me"

Sam McKenna's cold email method for high-value enterprise prospects and senior execs. Distilled from the [Apollo Academy masterclass](https://www.apollo.io/academy/master-classes/how-to-write-cold-emails-anyone-will-respond-to).

## Core Philosophy

- **SMYKM = "Show Me You Know Me"** — prove you researched the prospect as a human, not a pocketbook
- Only 8% of companies personalize outreach (McKinsey). Those who do see 75%+ increase in response rates
- Sam's benchmarks: 43% open rate, 20% reply rate (vs industry avg 6% open, 0.9% reply)

## Research Framework (3 Layers)

Spend \~30 min the first time. Drops to 5-7 min with practice. Quality > quantity for high-value leads.

### Layer 1: The Human
- **LinkedIn:** common connections, headline, about section, education, career path, interests, volunteering
- **CRM:** check for prior touchpoints, notes from colleagues

### Layer 2: The Company
- **Website:** resources page, press releases, values statement, charity/CSR work
- **Exec activity:** podcasts, conference talks, published articles, recent hires

### Layer 3: The Space
- **Vertical/industry lingo.** Match their language exactly.
  - Law firms say "clients" and "business development", not "sales" and "leads"
  - Healthcare says "patients" and "outcomes", not "users" and "metrics"
- Shows you operate in their world, not just yours

## Personalization Pitfalls (Don'ts)

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Inauthentic ties ("Go Noles!" with no FSU connection) | They'll see through it instantly |
| Private/creepy sources (Facebook, Yelp reviews, family photos) | Violates trust before you've built any |
| Personalization at scale ("Quick question", "Want to collaborate?", "Need more pipeline?") | Screams mass email |
| Pitch slapping (blank LinkedIn connect then immediate DM pitch) | Burns the channel for everyone |

**Rule:** Every SMYKM reference must authentically tie back to YOU.

## The Perfect Email (5 Parts)

### 1. Subject Line (Most Important)

The subject line is the gate. If it fails, nothing else matters.

- Include SMYKM content that only makes sense to the prospect
- Use **"+"** to break up topics: `Switzerland + Le Dip Cheeseburger + Apollo`
- Shorter is NOT necessarily better — specificity beats brevity
- Can be scaled: same fraternity/interest subject line works for multiple execs in that group

### 2. First Sentence (Second Most Important)

This is the preview text in their inbox. It decides whether they open.

**Option A — The Implied Introduction:**
> "We have yet to be properly introduced, but I'm [Name], [Title] of [Company]..."

Signals: you *should* have been introduced. Creates curiosity about who you are.

**Option B — Straight Into SMYKM:**
> Elaborate on the subject line with an authentic tie back to you.

**Do NOT** start with niceties ("Hope you're well") or a sales pitch.

### 3. Transition

Bridge from personal to business. Don't abruptly jump to the pitch.

> "I could talk about this all day. The real reason for my outreach however is..."

Stay conversational. Connect the dots naturally between the personal reference and your business reason.

### 4. Value Proposition + Objection Handling

State the **CHALLENGE** you solve, not what you do (that's a marketing email).

- Longer is better for execs — convince them time with you is well spent
- Anticipate their #1 objection and preemptively address it in the same paragraph

**Example flow:**
> **Challenge:** "Usage rates for sales tools hover around 5%..."
> **Value:** "We train your teams to actually adopt the tools they're paying for..."
> **Objection:** "You likely already have a CSM at LinkedIn, but rather than teaching which buttons to push, we teach how to sell socially..."

### 5. The Close

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Do you have time over the next week or two to learn more? Let me know what works for you, and I'll send a calendar invite along accordingly." | Calendar links (presumptuous, puts onus on them) |
| Work around THEIR calendar | Specific times ("Monday at 1pm?" — lets them say no, then you're chasing) |
| Keep it open and respectful | Demanding language ("Let's hop on a call tomorrow") |

## SMYKM Sequence Structure

| Step | Timing | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Research | During the week | Do all 3 layers of research |
| Email 1 | Thursday or Friday | Full 5-part SMYKM email |
| Email 2 | <48 hours later (Sat/Sun) | Same thread, don't change subject. Short: "Wanted to pop in and see if you've read my below email. I'd still be grateful for the chance to chat..." |
| Email 3 | A few days later | New angle or value add. Don't overthink exact timing. |
| Email 4 | A few days later | Another touch. Consider LinkedIn at this point. |
| LinkedIn touch | Around email 4-5 | Personalized connection request (see below). Do NOT use profile views or InMails. |

**LinkedIn connection request template:**
> "My name might look familiar as I've sent you a few emails. I would still be grateful for the chance to chat about how [company] can support [org]."

**If they accept and say "thanks" or nothing:**
> "Thank you so much for connecting. I look forward to staying in touch."

Do NOT pitch slap after they accept.

**Optimization tips:**
- A/B test sequences. Track which email # gets most responses and optimize.
- Use open triggers: if you see multiple opens from different locations/devices, reach back with humor.

## Beyond Email: Discovery Call Script

When the meeting happens, use this 3-part structure:

**Part 1 — Share about yourself (briefly):**
> "Thank you so much for making time for us today. I could tell you a million things about [company]: 1... 2... 3... (tailored to their buyer persona). But I would love to hear about you first..."

**Part 2 — Share what you know about them (SMYKM):**
> "I know you recently had an acquisition / are looking to double revenue / replaced your CRO..."

**Part 3 — Give breathing room + ask permission:**
> "Tell me about your team, your challenges, and what the overall landscape is like for you, if that's okay?"

This gets them talking for 2-9 minutes, often answering your qualification questions before you even ask.

## In-Person Meeting Tips

- Make the reservation yourself
- Add notes in reservation to bring the check to YOU at a specific time
- Show up early, take the seat facing the room
